# SmrtiLog - Keystroke logger simulation by SudoHopeX

A smart Keystroke logger that determines user's os name, username, admin access & sends them to a server ( [Keystroke Logger Server by SudoHopeX](https://sudohopex-smrti-log.vercel.app/) )


## SmrtiLog Keystroke logger features:
  - logs keystrokes
  - determines user's **os name**, **username**, **admin privilege** & send them only once
  - **fetches new encryption key from server each time** it sends logs to encrypt data
  - encrypt data using fetched key and **send encrypted data** to server every minute
  - stop program on **ESC** key press
  - simulates keystroke logger

- A Flask server to handle encrypted logs from a keylogger.
- Provides endpoints to get encryption keys and receive encrypted logs.
- Also includes a web interface to view and clear received logs.
- hosted on vercel
- all logs received by server are stored temporarily & removed automatically by vercel
